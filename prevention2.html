	<h2 class="SECOND">1. Report the cyberbullying material to the social media service it happened on</h2>
	  <p class="TEXT">
       -Social media services should remove cyberbullying material that is reported to them. Most social media services have a reporting area on their website.
	   Our Social media safety centers page also provides information about how to report material on various services.
	  </p>
	<h2 class="SECOND">2. Collect evidence of the cyberbullying material</h2>
	 <p class="TEXT">
      -Depending on where the cyberbullying material is posted, you might need to do this first, before you report it to the site. A simple way to collect 
       evidence is taking a photo or screenshot of the material. If you submit a complaint to us about the cyberbullying material, you will need 
	  to provide this evidence.
	 </p>
	<h2 class="SECOND">3. Report cyberbullying to the Office of the eSafety Commissioner</h2>
	 <p class="TEXT">
      -If the social media service fails to remove the material within 48 hours of you reporting it to them, you can make a complaint to the Office of 
	  the eSafety Commissioner.
	 </p>
	<h2 class="SECOND">4. Block the person</h2>
	  <p class="TEXT">
	  -We recommend that you block or unfriend the person upsetting you, so they cannot keep upsetting you while the material is being removed.
